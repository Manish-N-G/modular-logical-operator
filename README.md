# Logic Module Program

This project computes the logical and arithmetic operators for a string to individual modules:
We take a string input like (a==1)||(b1>3)&&(c_1!=5)||(d<=4) and gets the user parameters for the variables a,b1,c_1 and d.
The result is broken down into modules and then computed for them.
Ex: a==1: ,Enter value of a=5. 
Result for the modules (eg)= [false, true, false, true]
Main Result (eg)= [true]

This code is written in Rust. We convert to WebAssembly wasm code with the help of wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack.
The result can be gotten but the rust lib, html client interface and nodejs CLI.
